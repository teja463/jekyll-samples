By default the theme you are using provides layouts. If you want to override them you can do so by creating `_layouts` folder and create `.html` file witht the layout name.

You can also create your own layouts and use them in the pages or posts. You can also nest layouts so that you can define your html head and body tag in one layout and use that layout as parent inside another layout so that all the head and footer will come for all other layouts as well.
